# Class-11_C-Programming

This repository contains C programming lab assignments organized by lab number. Each lab folder contains C source files (`.c`) and their corresponding executables (`.exe`).

## Folder Structure

- **Lab1/**  
  Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

- **Lab2/**  
  Area calculations and currency conversion.

- **Lab3/**  
  Finding the middle and largest numbers among three inputs.

- **Lab4/**  
  Looping constructs (for, while, do-while) and series generation.

- **Lab5/**  
  Prime number check and palindrome check.

- **Lab6/**  
  Counting employees/persons based on salary/age ranges.

- **Lab7/**  
  Array operations: finding the largest number, matrix addition, and matrix multiplication.

- **Lab8/**  
  String operations: length, reverse, case conversion.

- **Lab9/**  
  Sorting numbers and names.

## How to Run

1. Open the desired `.c` file in your C compiler (e.g., Turbo C, GCC).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Alternatively, use the provided `.exe` files if you are on a compatible system.

## Example

To compile and run `Lab1/Lab1a.c` using GCC:

```sh
gcc Lab1/Lab1a.c -o Lab1/Lab1a.exe
./Lab1/Lab1a.exe
```
