## How to Run

1. Open the desired `.c` file in your C compiler (e.g., Turbo C, GCC).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Alternatively, use the provided `.exe` files if you are on a compatible system.

## Example

To compile and run `Lab1/Lab1a.c` using GCC:

```sh
gcc Lab1/Lab1a.c -o Lab1/Lab1a.exe
./Lab1/Lab1a.exe
```
